## Black-Scholes Model Calculate
This project is a simple implementation of the Black-Scholes Model. User inputs the parameters of B-S models and get the theoretical Option call and put prices. The input parameters are:
* Initial stock price
* Strike price
* Annual risk-free interest rate
* Time to maturity (in year)
* Volatility

The parameters of Merton Model will be:
* input parameters are:
* Initial stock price
* Strike price
* Annual risk-free interest rate
* Annual dividend yield
* Time to maturity (in year)
* Volatility
